### Project Description
[This code powers a compassionate Postpartum Support Chatbot, designed to listen, understand, and guide new parents through their emotional journey. By tracking moods and offering personalized responses, it provides a safe space of empathy and encouragement, fostering emotional well-being during a challenging time.]

### The Problem statement
[Postpartum depression and anxiety are common challenges faced by new parents, particularly mothers. Many new parents may feel isolated, overwhelmed, or uncertain about their mental and emotional well-being during this transitional phase. Access to immediate support and guidance is often limited, making it difficult for them to express their feelings or seek help. The lack of easily accessible resources, personalized emotional support, and immediate mental health interventions can delay recovery and worsen emotional distress.]

### The Solution
[Say hello to *Mam√°Mind*‚Äîyour friendly, always-there, virtual cheerleader! This chatbot is designed to bring a little sunshine to your postpartum journey, offering both support and fun whenever you need it. With a warm, empathetic vibe, *Mam√°Mind* listens to your moods, tracks how you're feeling, and responds with encouraging messages like ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre doing great!‚Äù or ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay to feel sad sometimes!‚Äù Plus, it‚Äôs packed with helpful info and links to mental health resources, making sure you‚Äôre never alone in your journey. Whether you need a mood boost, some solid advice, or just a virtual hug, *Mam√°Mind* is here to make this emotional rollercoaster a little easier (and a lot more supportive)!]
